Run is the missing manager for developers.

It helps to manage and re-use scripts more easily. After installing run, you get
the command run. Please run pt-summary and it will download the well-known
pt-summary to run. If you push your scripts to GitHub, you can simply use it
like run github:runscripts/scripts/pt-summary.
